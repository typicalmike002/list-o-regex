I kept using this regex tool so often that I wanted to create a list of urls to regular expressions I've collected for various things.  That way I can update them over time and hopefully see them improve as I use them more.

### Rules to this list

Make sure you give a regular expression a name, a description of what it does, and also make sure you save the actual regular expression itself incase the regex101 site decides to drop a database on a bad day.

#### Hours 1-24
^((1[0-9]|2[0-4])|[1-9])$<br />
(https://regex101.com/r/Nw1Vg9/3)[regex101]<br />
Matches from numbers 1 to 24 containing nothing else.
